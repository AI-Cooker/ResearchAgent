Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - Amazon SageMakerRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - Amazon SageMakerAWSDocumentationAmazon SageMakerDeveloper GuideRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)Foundation models are usually trained offline, making the model agnostic to any
                data that is created after the model was trained. Additionally, foundation models
                are trained on very general domain corpora, making them less effective for
                domain-specific tasks. You can use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve
                data from outside a foundation model and augment your prompts by adding the relevant
                retrieved data in context. For more information about RAG model architectures, see
                    Retrieval-Augmented Generation for
                    Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.With RAG, the external data used to augment your prompts can come from multiple
                data sources, such as a document repositories, databases, or APIs. The first step is
                to convert your documents and any user queries into a compatible format to perform
                relevancy search. To make the formats compatible, a document collection, or
                knowledge library, and user-submitted queries are converted to numerical
                representations using embedding language models. Embedding is the process by which text is given numerical
                representation in a vector space. RAG model architectures compare the embeddings of
                user queries within the vector of the knowledge library. The original user prompt is
                then appended with relevant context from similar documents within the knowledge
                library. This augmented prompt is then sent to the foundation model. You can update
                knowledge libraries and their relevant embeddings asynchronously.
