Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines retrieval-based and generative models to deliver accurate responses.

RAG works by first finding the most relevant documents to a user's query. The information from these documents is then fed into a generative model to create the final response. This allows for citations, which allows the end user to verify the sources and delve deeper into the information provided.

RAG can be used to build better AI chat experiences by reducing hallucinations in AI models and creating more accurate and evidence-based conversational experiences.
