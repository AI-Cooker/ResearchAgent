Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a relatively new artificial intelligence technique that can improve the quality of generative AI by allowing large language model (LLMs) to tap additional data resources without retraining.

RAG models build knowledge repositories based on the organization's own data, and the repositories can be continually updated to help the generative AI provide timely, contextual answers.

Chatbots and other conversational systems that use natural language processing can benefit greatly from RAG and generative AI.

Implementing RAG requires technologies such as vector databases, which allow for the rapid coding of new data, and searches against that data to feed into the LLM.

RAG is a relatively new technology, first proposed in 2020, AI developers are still learning how to best implement its information retrieval mechanisms in generative AI. Some key challenges are

Improving organizational knowledge and understanding of RAG because it's so new
Increasing costs; while generative AI with RAG will be more expensive to implement than an LLM on its own, this route is less costly than frequently retraining the LLM itself
Determining how to best model the structured and unstructured data within the knowledge library and vector database
Developing requirements for a process to incrementally feed data into the RAG system
Putting processes in place to handle reports of inaccuracies and to correct or delete those information sources in the RAG system
