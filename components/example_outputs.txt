My application have millions of records that also have high write/read frequency, what type of NoSQL I should use? Recommend me some NoSQL Database for this. I storing document data that are rarely change the structure.

-----
[ANSWER]

MongoDB is a good choice for applications with high write/read frequency and large datasets. It is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored in JSON-like documents. This makes it easy to store and query data, and it is also well-suited for applications that need to frequently add new data.

MongoDB also supports sharding, which means that data can be distributed across multiple servers. This can help to improve performance and scalability.

Some other NoSQL databases that you might consider include:

* Cassandra: Cassandra is a distributed database that is designed for high availability and scalability. It is well-suited for applications that need to process large amounts of data in real time.
* DynamoDB: DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that is offered by Amazon Web Services. It is designed for high performance and scalability, and it is well-suited for applications that need to process large amounts of data quickly.
* Couchbase: Couchbase is a distributed NoSQL database that is designed for high performance and scalability. It is well-suited for applications that need to process large amounts of data in real time.

Here are some specific recommendations for NoSQL databases for your application:

* If you need a database that is easy to use and that supports a wide variety of data types, then MongoDB is a good choice.
* If you need a database that is highly scalable and available, then Cassandra is a good choice.
* If you need a database that is fully managed and that offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, then DynamoDB is a good choice.
* If you need a database that is designed for high performance and scalability, then Couchbase is a good choice.

What are the current best LLM models, what should I use when I need to perform NLP tasks: like summarization, question answering,...?

-----
[ANSWER] The current best LLM models for summarization and question answering are T5 and BART. T5 is a transformer-based language model that was trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It can be used for a variety of tasks, including summarization, question answering, and translation. BART is another transformer-based language model that was trained on a massive dataset of text. It is specifically designed for summarization and question answering tasks.

When choosing which LLM model to use for a particular task, it is important to consider the size of the model and the type of data that it was trained on. T5 is a larger model than BART, and it was trained on a more diverse dataset. This means that it is more likely to be able to generalize to new tasks. However, BART is a faster model than T5, and it is specifically designed for summarization and question answering tasks. This means that it may be a better choice for tasks where speed is important.

Ultimately, the best LLM model for a particular task will depend on the specific requirements of the task. If you are not sure which model to use, it is a good idea to experiment with both T5 and BART to see which one performs better on your particular task.

My application have too many queries on a few tables, come from many services, what should I do to improve the performance of the system?
